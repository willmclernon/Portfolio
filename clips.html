    <h3> Last of his qualifier breed, Will Chandler had one wild week at the WM Phoenix Open </h3>
    <p> Will Chandler played himself one wild and long week of golf. From competing in the WM Phoenix Open’s last-ever Monday qualifier to earning a coveted spot in the tournament — where he finished tied for sixth in just his third PGA Tour event — the 27-year-old underdog found himself walking down the 18th fairway on Sunday with the world’s top-ranked golfer, Scottie Scheffler.</p>

    <h3>
        Grow Canada: All 6 Canadian PGA Tour players at WM Phoenix Open making the cut </h3>
    <p> 
     PGA Tour veteran Adam Hadwin loves hearing “O Canada” when he hits a good shot in the coliseum-like 16th hole at TPC Scottsdale. When he sank a 13.5-foot birdie putt on Friday morning, the Saskatchewan native gave the rowdy crowd a reason to erupt. </p>
     <p>That electrifying putt contributed to a near-historic run for the 37-year-old Canuck as he birdied seven straight holes during the second round of the WM Phoenix Open — falling just two short of the PGA Tour’s all-time longest birdie streak. He was one of four Canadians in the top 20 after the second round and all six Canadians in the field made the weekend cut, a sight that is becoming more and more common.

 <h3> Golf influencers drawing big crowds, ascending to celebrity status at WM Phoenix Open</h3>
    <p> The PGA players clearly aren’t the only stars at the WM Phoenix Open this week.</p>
    <p>Nick Trapman waited eagerly on the right of the 10th hole fairway of TPC Scottsdale as Wyndham Clark teed off during Wednesday’s Annexus Pro-Am. And when Clark’s drive landed near him, Trapman seized a golden opportunity to ask for a picture. But it was not with whom you’d expect. </p>
    <p>Instead of asking for a shot of 2023 U.S. Open champion, he wanted a photo with his caddie for the day, Robby Berger, a member of the popular YouTube Channel "Bob Does Sports," which has 993,000 subscribers. It was an apt snapshot of the impact golf influencers have had on the growing popularity of the sport. </P>

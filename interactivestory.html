<H2> NHL’s 4 Nations Faceoff shows USA is catching up to Canada as the world’s best hockey nation</H2>
<p>Team USA sent a message during NHL’s 4 Nations Face-Off that they are closing in on Canada as the world’s top hockey country. </p>
<p> The Americans beat their northern rivals in the group stage in a thrilling 3-1 victory which featured three fights in the first nine seconds, but fell just short of hoisting the 4 Nations trophy in Boston after Canada’s Connor McDavid sniped a shot from the slot past Team USA goalie Connor Hellebuyck in overtime.</p>
<p> This tournament was a case of deja-vu for die-hard American hockey fans. McDavid’s tournament clinching goal was eerily similar to Sidney Crosby’s overtime golden-goal to beat Team USA in the 2010 Vancouver Olympics</p>

<p>The 4 Nations win marked the sixth time the Canadians have emerged victorious in the last seven best-on-best internationals hockey tournaments.</p>

<p>However, the American fan base has a reason to be optimistic going forward because tournament results aren’t the only thing getting tighter. Hockey participation in the USA is inching closer and closer to surpassing Canada as the highest in the world. </p>
<p>During the 2004-2005 season, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UTQK1odDM4yK8Wt3DI-oRjL5F0Axv4Iopb443Hu_0AQ/edit?gid=0#gid=0">Hockey Canada had 98,695 more registered players than their American counterparts</a>, but that gap has now been reduced to 24,544. </p>
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/21765134"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/21765134/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="chart visualization" /></noscript></div>
<P>USA Hockey actually had higher player participation from the 2020-2021 season until the 2022-2023 season, but stricter COVID-19 measures in Canada, growing costs to play the game and five former Canadian world juniors players being charged in a sexual assault case loikely played a role in the three year irregularity.  </P>
<P>This closing of the gap can be partially attributed to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gDqhuva9Jvq1Pdv6BOAGV0fN0x9OUJnzJRx1DiwoW3o/edit?gid=639271811#gid=639271811" >increased participation in some of the USA’s southern states.</a> </P>
<p>For example, the number of registered male hockey players in California has nearly doubled in the past 20 years from 16,758 in 2004 to 32,201 in 2024, Florida’s participation has jumped from 8,637 to 21,199, Texas has seen a rise from 6,677 to 16,498 and Arizona has seen participation nearly triple from 3,627 players to 9,524.</p>
<p> The rise of hockey interest in these Sun Belt states could be linked to having strong NHL teams in the area. Nine of the past 20 Stanley Cups have been won by teams in the Sun Belt despite only 10 of the NHL’s 32 teams being from the region. </p>

<p>This increased participation of non-traditional hockey states is helping diversify the American talent pool in the NHL. QuantHockey reports there are 283 Americans currently playing in the NHL with 36 states having at least one player being born within their borders, but the Midwest and Northeast are still producing the most pros.</p>
<p>Minnesota is currently the best represented state in the NHL <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Vc9eYlCTR53yEwr-NufnEB0aDGPVM4xRdF2LkN-cZSI/edit?gid=0#gid=0">with 46 active players</a> including four 4 Nations roster members. Michigan was <a href= "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RH0yHy4pqlMZmPdq1tqz4YUHb2eMLS9BrtGw1hl1Kt4/edit?gid=0#gid=0">the most-represented at the best-on-best tournament</a> with five players, but the team’s captain Auston Matthews came from a non-traditional hockey background.</p>
<p>Matthews was born in California, but raised in Arizona where he developed a love for hockey watching the Arizona Coyotes. His hockey journey started at just five-years-old playing for the Jr. Coyotes— a youth hockey program affiliated with the former NHL team in Arizona.</p>
<p>The top pick in the 2016 NHL Draft and current captain of the Toronto Maple Leafs is the poster-boy example of the growth of the game in the southern United States. The 27-year-old has developed into one of the NHL’s biggest stars, leading the league in goals three of the past four seasons.</p>

<p> TV viewership shows the 4 Nations Face-Off was incredibly successful in terms of growing interest in the game in the USA.</p>
<p> <a href="https://espnpressroom.com/us/press-releases/2025/02/4-nations-face-off-usa-canada-game-delivers-4-4m-viewers-most-viewed-non-stanley-cup-final-hockey-telecast-since-2019/amp/">ESPN reported</a> the group stage game between Canada and the Americans averaged 4.4 million viewers, peaking at 5.2 million making it the most-viewed non-Stanley Cup Final game since 2019. However, the total viewership was likely much higher due to people watching in bars, at parties and fans illegaly streaming it.</p>
<p>That game was just the precursor to an even more successful showing during Thursday’s final. The USA-Canada rematch generated <a href="https://espnpressroom.com/us/press-releases/2025/02/4-nations-face-off-canada-usa-championship-game-delivers-9-3m-viewers-espns-largest-hockey-audience-ever/"> 9.3 million viewers on ESPN</a> making it the most-ever watched non-Olympic hockey game in the United States since the Nielsen people-meter era which was established in 1988.  </p>
<p>The 2010 Olympic final in Vancouver between the two neighbouring nations averaged 27.6 million viewes on NBC.
<p>If there's a rematch between the Americans and Canadians at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan, there's a good chance that total could be topped thanks to growth of the game in the USA. </p>

<H3> Methodology </H3>
<p>For this story, I primarily took data from USA Hockey and Hockey Canada annual reports. For the change in total registered players, I went through the past 20 annual reports for both countries to get the figures and manually put them into a spreadsheet. USA Hockey had a page on its website with all of its past annual reports. Finding Hockey Canada data was a little bit more difficult as I had to search separately for some of the older reports. Once I had data from the past 20 years, I entered it into Flourish to create a basic line chart showing the change in registration for the two countries over the past 20 years. </p>
<p> For the player registration by state information, I used Google Pinpoint to extract data from the USA Hockey’s 2023-2024 Annual Report pdf file because it wasn’t available in CSV Format. I uploaded that data into an excel file. This involved some data clean-up because there were categories for each age which weren’t needed, I also had to combine the figures for western and eastern Pennsylvania to get the state total. Once I had all the data cleaned up, I added it into Flourish to create a projection map showcasing which states had the most USA Hockey registered players. Then in the text portion of the story, I compared those figures for certain sun-belt states to their figures in 2004 to showcase the growth of the game in the south.
<p>For the NHL players by state graphic, I took data from QuantHockey which listed the number of players born in each state.That data does fluctuate based on players on active rosters, the data I used was from Feb 22. I couldn’t get a CSV file for it so I had to enter it manually in google sheets. Once I had the number for each state I added it to Flourish to create a projection map to showcase which state produces the most NHL players, but I wanted to show where each member of the USA 4 Nations roster was from. So I created a spreadsheet to display each player, their hometown with coordinates, age, position and NHL team. I added that to Flourish basing each point off the coordinates of their hometown and then used the info-popups options to showcase the info for each player. 
<p>Lastly for the 4 Nations TV viewership stats, I based it off official numbers provided by ESPN. For the Vancouver stats, I got them from an article off ESPN which I hyperlinked to in the story. </p>

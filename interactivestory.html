<H2> NHL’s 4 Nations Faceoff shows USA is catching up to Canada as the world’s best hockey nation</H2>
<div id="byline">By <a href="#contact">Will McLernon</a></div>
<p>Team USA sent a message during NHL’s 4 Nation’s Faceoff that they are closing in on Canada as the world’s top hockey country. </p>
<p> The Americans beat their northern rivals in the group stage in a thrilling 3-1 victory which featured three fights in the first nine seconds, but fell just short of hoisting the 4 Nations trophy in Boston after Canada’s Connor McDavid sniped a shot from the slot past Team USA goalie Connor Hellebuyck in overtime.</p>
<p> This tournament was a case of deja-vu for die-hard American hockey fans. McDavid’s tournament clinching goal was eerily similar to Sidney Crosby’s overtime golden-goal to beat Team USA in the 2010 Vancouver Olympics</p>
<p>The 4 Nations win marked the sixth time the Canadians have emerged victorious in the last seven best-on-best internationals hockey tournaments.</p>
<p>However, the American fan base has a reason to be optimistic going forward because tournament results aren’t the only thing getting tighter. Hockey participation in the USA is inching closer and closer to surpassing Canada as the highest in the world. </p>
<p>During the 2004-2005 season Hockey Canada had 98,695 more registered players than their American counterparts, but fast forward 20 years later that gap has now been reduced to about 24,544. </p>

<P>USA Hockey actually had higher player participation from the 2020-2021 season until the 2022-2023 season, but stricter COVID-19 measures in Canada, growing costs to play the game and five former Canadian world juniors players being charged in a sexual assault case loikely played a role in the three year irregularity.  </P>
<P>This closing of the gap can be partially attributed to increased participation in some of the USA’s southern states. </P>
<p>For example, the number of registered male hockey players in California has nearly doubled in the past 20 years from 16,758 in 2004 to 32,201 in 2024, Florida’s participation has jumped from 8,637 to 21,199, Texas has seen a rise from 6,677 to 16,498 and Arizona has seen participation nearly triple from 3,627 players to 9,524.</p>
<p> The rise of hockey interest in these Sun Belt states could be linked to having strong NHL teams in the area. Nine of the past 20 Stanley Cups have been won by teams in the Sun Belt despite only 10 of the NHL’s 32 teams being from the region. </p>
